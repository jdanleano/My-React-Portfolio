      <p>
        My name is Joseph, and I am currently a student in the Penn LPS Coding
        Boot Camp. I have worked as an Audio Engineer and a Pharmacy Technician,
        but have really been drawn to computer work and other tech related work.
        I decided to join this program to further my knowlege in tech, and
        hopfully find a career in the web development industry. In my spare
        time, I enjoy creating and listening to music, learning about coding,
        and watching videos about technology.
